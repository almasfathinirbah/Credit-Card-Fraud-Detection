# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Objective
* Created several models that we're able to predict credit card fraud and chose the best model.

## Result
* Supervised machine learning used that are Adaboost, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, XGBoost, K Neighbor, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

* Random Forest is the best supervised machine learning model in this project.
  * Precision = 86%
  * Recall = 74%
  * F1 Score = 79%
  * AUC score = 99%
  * Confussion Matrix;

* Hyperparameter Tuning in the Random Forest does not affect to increase the F1 score.
